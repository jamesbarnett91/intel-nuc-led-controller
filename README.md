# Intel NUC LED Controller
GUI and command line tool to control the front panel LED ring on Intel NUCs.
Requires the 'SW Control' option to be set in the BIOS.
This application request to run as admin in order to use the WMI interface to control the LED.

I'm not a C# developer so some of this may be janky.
